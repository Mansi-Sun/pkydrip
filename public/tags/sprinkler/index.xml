      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-overview&#34;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This irrigation scheme aims to provide efficient and precise irrigation services for 3 hectares of banana plantation in Zambia. Banana trees require a large amount of water to grow, and have high requirements for the stability and uniformity of water supply. By adopting a sprinkler irrigation system, using well water as a water source, and matching professional filtering and fertilization equipment, it is ensured that banana trees can obtain appropriate water and nutrients at different growth stages to achieve increased production and quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
