faq:
  - question: "How far can the system communicate wirelessly?"
    answer: "Our LoRa-based controllers and sensors can transmit up to 3.5 km in open space. For longer distances, you can add signal repeaters or mesh nodes."
  - question: "How long does the battery last in solar-powered terminals?"
    answer: "Typically 1–3 years depending on control frequency and transmission intervals. We offer 3-year and 5-year battery options."
  - question: "Can the system work without internet?"
    answer: "Yes. All machines have an offline version. You can operate via touchscreen or local interface even in remote areas without network."
  - question: "Does it support EC/pH sensor feedback control?"
    answer: "The PKY-FG401 supports real-time EC/pH detection and automatic fertilizer adjustment based on your target values."
  - question: "What kind of valves or pipes are required?"
    answer: "The machine supports electric solenoid valves (DC 12/24V) and standard UPVC/PE/HDPE irrigation pipelines with DE32~DE50 connections."
  - question: "Can I customize the control logic?"
    answer: "Yes. Our team can pre-program schedules and conditions according to your crop, zone, and irrigation strategy."

  - Choosing the right fertigation unit depends on your crop type, irrigation area, fertilizer strategy, and control needs. Below is a simple guide to help you decide:


  - ✔ Home Garden or Small Greenhouse: Use 1-channel manual unit or timer controller


  - ✔ Greenhouse with up to 3 different fertilizer types: [PKY-FG301 – 3-Channel Machine](/product/pky-fg301/)


  - ✔ Greenhouse or Orchard with EC/pH monitoring needs: [PKY-FG401 – 4-Channel with EC/pH](/product/pky-fg401-ecph/)


  - ✔ Multiple large zones with custom fertilizer plans: Ask us about the PKY-FG701 (7-channel) version


  If you’re not sure, send us your irrigation area, crop type, and preferred control style. We’ll recommend the best solution."

> **What is a Fertigation System?**
A fertigation system integrates irrigation and fertilizer delivery into one automated platform. PKYDrip’s fertigation units allow precise nutrient mixing, automatic scheduling, and multi-zone irrigation control with support for EC/pH monitoring and cloud connectivity.

Whether you manage a greenhouse, orchard, or open-field irrigation project, our modular designs adapt to your operation scale and control needs.
