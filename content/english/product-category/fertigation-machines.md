**What is a Fertigation System?**
A fertigation system integrates irrigation and fertilizer delivery into one automated platform. PKYDripâ€™s fertigation units allow precise nutrient mixing, automatic scheduling, and multi-zone irrigation control with support for EC/pH monitoring and cloud connectivity.

Whether you manage a greenhouse, orchard, or open-field irrigation project, our modular designs adapt to your operation scale and control needs.
