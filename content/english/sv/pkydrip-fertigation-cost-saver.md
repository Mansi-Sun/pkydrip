Our fertigation machines and irrigation controllers are built for real farms, not factories. Whether you're managing a fruit orchard, greenhouse, or open-field vegetable farm, you get:


**Case Study: Small-Scale Vegetable Farm**


**Challenge:** A small family farm struggled with inconsistent vegetable yields and high fertilizer costs due to manual application and inefficient irrigation.


**PKYDrip Solution:** We designed a compact, automated fertigation system tailored to their specific crop rotation and limited budget. Provided hands-on guidance for local procurement of pipes and fittings, and remote assembly support.


**Results:**


  - **30% reduction in fertilizer use** in the first season.


  - **15% increase in vegetable yield** and improved consistency.


  - Total project cost was **40% lower** than quotes for standard European systems.


  - System installed and running within **2 weeks** with our guidance.
