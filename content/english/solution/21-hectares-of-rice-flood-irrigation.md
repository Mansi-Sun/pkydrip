> Previous irrigation plans were all customized water-saving plans for customers. Today we will introduce a customized rice flooding plan using water hoses.

### 1. Plan adaptability
Rice growth has extremely strict water requirements. From the seedling stage to the tillering stage, the booting stage to the filling stage, each stage is inseparable from the precise water supply. The water hose flooding method perfectly matches the growth characteristics of rice.</p>

### 2. Water hose laying planning
We use high-quality and high-strength water hoses and lay them scientifically and reasonably according to the terrain and layout of the rice fields. For square and regular fields, the parallel laying method is adopted. The entire farmland is divided into 10 irrigation areas, and multiple water hoses are laid in each area to ensure uniform coverage of irrigation water.</p>

### 3. Irrigation implementation process
Preliminary preparation: Before irrigation, conduct a comprehensive and detailed inspection of the water hose to check whether there are any damage, cracks, etc., and repair or replace defective water hoses in time. At the same time, clean up the debris in the field to ensure that the water flows smoothly.</p>

Irrigation operation: turn on the water source and slowly adjust the valve to ensure that the water flows smoothly into the hose.</p>

Final finishing: After the irrigation is completed, turn off the water source and all valves, and slowly drain the remaining water in the hose to prevent the hose from being damaged by long-term immersion in water. Put away the hose carefully, clean it and store it properly for next use. â€‹</p>

### Conclusion
Compared with drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation systems, water hose flooding requires almost no complicated equipment installation. The operation process does not involve complicated technology, and farmers can easily get started. It has obvious advantages in rice planting areas with low labor costs, large terrain undulations, and irregular field shapes.</p>
