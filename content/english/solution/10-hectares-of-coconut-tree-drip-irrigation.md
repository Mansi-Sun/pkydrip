> In the vast land of Brazil, 10 hectares of flat fertile land breeds 2050 young coconut trees full of hope. In order to make these lives thrive, a highly innovative and scientific irrigation plan has made a stunning debut.

### Water supply
The solution uses an 80-meter-deep groundwater well as the water source and is equipped with a 2-inch submersible pump. Its powerful extraction capacity can continuously provide a stable water source for the entire irrigation system.

### Water purification
The extracted groundwater will first flow through a 4-inch laminated filter. This equipment can efficiently remove tiny impurities in the water, effectively ensure the normal operation of subsequent irrigation equipment, extend the service life of the equipment, and reduce maintenance costs.

### Pressure monitoring and safety assurance
The pressure gauge installed in the system can monitor the pipeline pressure in real time to ensure that the water pressure is always in the optimal working range. At the same time, the reasonable configuration of the exhaust valve effectively avoids the occurrence of air blockage in the pipeline and ensures the safe and efficient operation of the entire pipeline system.

### Irrigation method
Precise drip irrigation, a pioneer in water saving. By drilling holes in the PE pipe and installing a dripper with a flow rate of 16L/H, precise irrigation is carried out around each coconut tree. This drip irrigation method not only greatly reduces the waste of water resources, but also saves labor costs.

### Supplies needed for this irrigation
