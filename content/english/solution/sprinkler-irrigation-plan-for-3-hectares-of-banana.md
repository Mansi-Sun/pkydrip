### Project Overview
This irrigation scheme aims to provide efficient and precise irrigation services for 3 hectares of banana plantation in Zambia. Banana trees require a large amount of water to grow, and have high requirements for the stability and uniformity of water supply. By adopting a sprinkler irrigation system, using well water as a water source, and matching professional filtering and fertilization equipment, it is ensured that banana trees can obtain appropriate water and nutrients at different growth stages to achieve increased production and quality.</p>

### Irrigation system design
Main pipe and branch pipe laying: The main pipe uses a 63mm pipe, and the branch pipe uses a 32mm pipe. The main pipe is responsible for drawing water from the well and transporting it to various areas of the plantation, while the branch pipe branches from the main pipe and distributes water to specific irrigation areas.</p>

Micro sprinkler layout: A row of micro sprinklers is laid between two rows of banana trees, with a spacing of 3 meters between banana trees, a sprinkler spray radius of 3.5 meters, and 1 sprinkler set every 5 meters. This layout ensures that the spraying range of adjacent sprinklers overlaps partially, achieving comprehensive and uniform irrigation.</p>

### Equipment selection
Water source equipment: Use well water as the water source to ensure that the water source is stable and reliable.</p>

Filter equipment: Equipped with 1 laminated filter to effectively filter impurities in the well water, prevent micro-sprinklers from being blocked, and ensure the normal operation of the irrigation system.</p>

Fertilizer equipment: Equipped with 1 Venturi fertilizer applicator, fertilization can be carried out simultaneously during the irrigation process to achieve water-fertilizer integration, improve fertilizer utilization, and save manpower.</p>

### Installation and maintenance of irrigation system
Installation points: The pipeline should be laid to ensure the slope for easy drainage; the micro-sprinkler should be installed firmly and at a moderate height to avoid damage and affect the spraying effect.

Maintenance measures: Check the filter regularly and clean the laminate; check the nozzle regularly for blockage or damage and replace it in time; check the pipeline regularly for water leakage and repair it in time.
