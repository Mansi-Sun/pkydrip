> Rain pipe plays an important role in the corn field irrigation. Its low price and uniform spraying make it the first choice of many growers.
### Basic situation of farmland
Let’s take a look at this case. The area of ​​this farmland is 100*400m, and the rain pipe spray distance is about 5m, and the laying length shall not exceed 70m. The water source is well water, which needs to be matched with a disc filter.

### Main pipeline layout
According to the farmland topography and water source location, the main water supply belt with a diameter of 63mm is laid in a straight line along the long side of the farmland or the side with higher terrain. Through the reasonable setting of positive tees, direct and valve fittings, effective connection with branch pipelines is achieved, and a backbone network for irrigation water transportation is constructed to ensure that water flows smoothly to various areas of the farmland.

### Micro-spraying belt layout
50mm rain pipe is laid perpendicular to the main pipeline. The laying length of the micro-spraying belt shall not exceed 70 meters to ensure the end water pressure and spraying uniformity.</p>

During the laying process, the rain pipe is tightly connected to the main pipeline using a reducing tee, connecting pipe fittings and plugs, and the water flow of each micro-spraying belt is accurately controlled by valves to open and close, ensuring that each crop can get appropriate water supply.</p>

### Advantages of this irrigation solution
With its scientific equipment configuration, reasonable layout planning and significant advantages, this irrigation solution can provide efficient, precise, water-saving and stable irrigation services for 100×400 meters of farmland, helping agricultural production to achieve green, high-yield and sustainable development. It is an ideal choice for modern agricultural irrigation.
