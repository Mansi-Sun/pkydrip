### Background
> This scheme is designed for a 1 hectare tomato planting area, aiming to use drip irrigation technology to achieve efficient irrigation, provide stable and accurate water supply for tomato growth, improve water resource utilization efficiency, and increase yield and quality.

### System composition
#### Head hub

Only retain the laminated filter as the core component to filter impurities in the irrigation water source and prevent the drip irrigation belt from clogging.

#### Pipeline network system

**1.Main pipe:** Select a 63mm diameter PE hose, which has good corrosion resistance and flexibility, is easy to transport, and can adapt to different terrain conditions.</p>
**2.Drip irrigation belt:** Select an internal patch drip irrigation belt with a dripper spacing of 30cm. This drip irrigation belt has the characteristics of uniform water discharge and strong anti-clogging ability, and can provide a stable water supply for tomato plants. The drip irrigation belt is laid along the tomato planting row, on one side of the plant, 15-20cm away from the root of the plant, and can be fine-tuned according to the actual planting situation.</p>
### Installation steps
**1.Main pipe installation:** Drill holes on the PE hose according to the designed spacing and install the connectors.
 

**2.Drip tape installation:** Lay the drip tape in the tomato planting row according to the predetermined position. When laying, the dripper of the drip tape should face upward to prevent impurities from entering the dripper and causing blockage. During the laying of the drip tape, it is necessary to avoid twisting and folding of the drip tape to ensure that the drip tape can discharge water normally.

### Advantages of this irrigation solution
**1.Water-saving:** Taking 1 hectare of tomato planting area as an example, a large amount of irrigation water can be saved every year, which effectively reduces the consumption of water resources and reduces irrigation costs.
 

**2.Yield-increasing:** The drip tape can accurately transport water to the roots of tomato plants, provide suitable water conditions for plant growth, promote plant growth and development, and increase fruit yield and quality.
 

**3.Labor-saving:** The operation of the drip irrigation system is relatively simple. Compared with traditional manual irrigation methods, it greatly reduces labor input, reduces labor intensity, and improves irrigation efficiency and management efficiency.
