#### Irrigation Planning Basics

**Q:How do I start planning an irrigation system?**
A:Begin by identifying your planting location, crop type, rainfall, evaporation rates, and soil conditions. Understanding your local climate and plant requirements is crucial.

**Q:What crop information do I need?**
A:Know the crop type, water retention capacity, and planting pattern. These affect water volume, frequency, and distribution method.

**Q:How do I estimate water needs?**
A:Estimate based on climate (rainfall & evaporation), crop water demand, and soil water-holding capacity.



#### Water Quality and Soil Testing

**Q:Why water quality is important?**
A:Water quality affects clogging risk, fertigation compatibility, and crop health. Measure pH, EC, and contaminants.

**Q:What soil tests are needed?**
A:Measure nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, and organic matter. Use test kits or digital sensors.



#### Pump and Filtration Selection

**Q:How do I select the right pump?**
A:Consider area size, crop demand, lift height, and water source. Match pump power (kW), head (m), and flow rate (m³/h) to requirements.

**Q:What filtration system should I use?**
A:Choose based on water source (well, river, tank) and quality. Options include screen filters, disc filters, or sand media filters.



#### Fertigation System Design

**Q:What type of fertigation system should I choose?**
A:Depends on budget and precision needs. Choose from venturi injectors, pressure-driven units, or fully automated machines with EC/pH sensors.

**Q:How many fertilizer channels do I need?**
A:Depends on number of fertilizers used. Basic systems use 1-2 channels; advanced systems may use 3+ for N, P, K control.



#### Energy Source and Automation

**Q:What power source options are available?**
A:Common options include 220V, 380V electricity, solar panels, or diesel-powered pumps.

**Q:Can the system be automated?**
A:Yes. Use controllers with timers, WiFi/4G connectivity, and sensors for full automation.



#### Mainline and Valve Configuration

**Q:How do I choose main pipe diameter?**
A:Base it on flow rate and field layout. Use pressure gauge and flow meter for sizing.

**Q:What additional fittings are needed?**
A:Air release valves, check valves, pressure regulators are often required.

**Q:Do I need pressure regulators on slopes?**
A:Yes. Use pressure regulators on hilly terrain to balance pressure between zones.




#### Emitters and Field Layout

**Q:How do I select emitters?**
A:Choose between drip lines, micro-sprayers, and sprinklers based on crop type and water delivery needs.

**Q:How do I divide irrigation zones?**
A:Group zones by plant type, water needs, and topography. Control each with a separate valve.

**Q:How many solenoid valves are needed?**
A:One per zone. Choose DC, AC, or pulse valves based on controller type and power supply.



#### Greenhouse & Sensor Systems

**Q:What systems are used in greenhouses?**
A:Greenhouses may use grow lights, CO₂ generators, fans, and misting systems, all of which can be automated.

**Q:What sensors should I install?**
A:Options include soil moisture, NPK, EC, temperature/humidity, CO₂, and light intensity sensors.
